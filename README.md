### Distibution support
| Distribution          | Arch           | Note |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ---- |

| Raspbian 11 32-bit    | armhf          | Compile indi with build_indi.sh<br />The rawpy module is not availble on 32-bit Arm, therefore DNG/raw libcamera image processing is not available (jpeg/png still possible) |

MacOS support is theoretically possible, but not tested.

### libcamera support
libcamera is a new camera interface designed to replace the legacy camera interfaces such as V4L2.

Proper libcamera support is only working on Raspbian 11 64-bit on Raspberry Pi 3 & 4.

Note: Genererating and processing raw (dng) files on a system with less than 1GB of memory and libcamera will cause out-of-memory conditions.  There is an option to generate JPEG or PNG files with libcamera which solves this issue.


## Installation
1. Install git
```
apt-get install git
```
2. Clone the indi-allsky git repository
```
git clone https://github.com/aaronwmorris/indi-allsky.git
```
3. Navigate to the indi-allky sub-directory
```
cd indi-allsky/
```
4. Run setup.sh to install the relevant software
```
./setup.sh
```
 * Note:  You may be prompted for a password for sudo
5. Start the software
```
systemctl --user start indiserver
systemctl --user start indi-allsky
```
6. Login to the indi-allsky web application
https://raspberrypi.local/
 * Note: The web server is configured with a self-signed certificate.

### Manual operation
1. Stop indi-allsky service
```
systemctl --user stop indi-allsky
```
2. Activate the indi-allsky python virtual environment
```
source virtualenv/indi-allsky/bin/activate
```
3. Start indi-allsky
```
./allsky.py run
```

### Logs
* When indi-allsky is run from the command line, logs are sent to STDERR by default.
* When the indi-allsky service is started, logs are sent to syslog via facility local6.  Logs are stored in /var/log/indi-allsky/indi-allsky.log and rotated daily.


### Dark frames
indi-allsky fully automates the capture and processing of master dark calibration frames. Currently, sigma clipping and average methods are supported.

https://github.com/aaronwmorris/indi-allsky/wiki/Dark-Calibration-Frames


### Moon mode

This is a special night time operating mode intended to reduce gain when the moon is more illuminated and above the horizon


## Keograms
Keograms are a visual representation of the entire timelapse video in a single frame.  Every image is rotated so that the vertical aligns to the meridian and then the center-vertical column is extraced from each frame and compiled into the keogram.  The rotation parameter in the config is KEOGRAM_ANGLE

https://github.com/aaronwmorris/indi-allsky/wiki/Keogram-Rotation

Below you can see perodic clouds passed over between 8-9pm and again between 4-5am.  If you look closely enough, you can see the Pleiades star cluster and the Orion constellation as it passed through the meridian in this example keogram.

![](./content/keogram_example.jpg)

Note: The horizontal lines are just hot pixels that were subtracted by the dark frame.


## Star Trails
Star trail images stack the stars from each frame to show their progression across the sky.

### Star Trails Timelapse

## Star Detection
indi-allsky utilizes OpenCV pattern matching to detect and count the number of stars in the view.  Star counts are a good objective measurement of sky conditions.

Star and meteor detection support using detection masks to customize your Region of Interest if there are obstructions in your view.
https://github.com/aaronwmorris/indi-allsky/wiki/Detection-Masks

## Meteor Detection
Using OpenCV Canny edge detection and Hough Line Transform, indi-allsky is able to perform basic line detection to detect meteor and fireball trails in the view.  Airplane and satellite trails are also detected using this method.  Images are tagged with an asterisk in the image viewer if a trail has been detected.

## Focus Mode
Focus mode is a special setting that generates images more often and implements a Variance of Laplacian scoring algorithm on the image to assist with focusing the camera.  Images are not saved when focus mode is enabled.

## Web Interface

The indi-allsky web interface is built on the Flask MVC framework.  It is designed to be a dashboard for your sky.  Included is the ability to fully manage the camera configuration without having to manually edit from the command line.

The default credentials for accessing the web interface are user `admin` and password `secret`

An unauthenticated public access URL is also available at https://raspberrypi.local/indi-allsky/public  (actual hostname may vary)

### Home Page

### Charts
Early evening, the sun was still going down, but a cloud passed by, increasing the average brightness and lowering the star count.
![](./content/webui_chart01.png)

A large cloud passed over significantly increasing the brightness of the sky and blocking out almost all of the stars.

### Image viewer

### Timelapse viewer

### System Info
![](./content/webui_systeminfo.png)


## Database

All media generated are logged in a local SQLite database stored in /var/lib/indi-allsky/indi-allsky.sqlite  This database is used as the source of images for timelapse and keogram generation, as well as, for displaying images via the web interfaces.

The database is managed via the python modules SQLAlchemy and alembic to provide migrations (schema upgrades) automatically in the setup.sh script.

## GPS

GPS support is provided through [indi_gpsd](https://www.indilib.org/aux/gps.html) and GPSd integration.  Any GPS hardware supported by GPSd will work.

FITs Images exported [optional] by indi-allsky will be properly tagged with Geographic (latitude/longitude) and Astrometric (RA/dec) information in the headers.

## Performance

indi-allsky itself is written in python, but python is just the glue between the different libraries, most of which are C based which makes indi-allsky extremely fast.  A 1920 x 1080 image can be dark frame calibrated, debayered, histogram processed, text applied, and compressed to a JPG in less than 0.5 seconds on Raspberry Pi 3 class hardware.  PNG processing is a little more taxing, but usually only takes a few seconds.

ffmpeg video processing is considerably more expensive.  A 2 minute 1920x1080 h.264 encoded video compiled from 3,000 frames requires ~20 minutes on Raspberry Pi 3 (4 core) hardware.  Encoding takes place in a separate process from image aqcuisition and image processing and is run at the lowest CPU priority so image acquision is not impacted.

## Architecture

indi-allsky utilizes python's multiprocessing library to enable parallelizing tasks so that image processing does not interfere with image aquisition, etc.

## Tested Hardware

I have extensively tested the ZWO ASI290MM and the Svbony SV305.  3-4 weeks of steady runtime with no intervention are common.  The only reason I restart my cameras are code updates (or power failures).

The hardware below has at least been plugged in and tested for correct detection and CFA decoding.

| Vendor   | Model               | Rating | Notes |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| Svbony   | SV305               | B      | ~20% of frames require double the configured exposure time to complete. Likely a firmware bug. |

If you have an INDI supported camera from a vendor not listed, open an enhancement request and I can work with you to support the camera.


## Gotchas
Common problems you might run into.

* The indi-allsky python processes consume ~500MB of RAM.
    * 1K (1920x1080) h.264 encoding with ffmpeg requires an additional ~500MB of RAM.  1GB of RAM should be the bare minimum system memory.  You should also have 100-500MB of additional swap space to prevent running out of memory during encoding.  2GB of RAM recommended.
    * 4K (3840x2160) h.264 encoding requires an additional 2+GB of RAM.  4GB of RAM recommended.
    * Above 4K resolution requires greater than 4GB of RAM.
* In Raspbian 10 (legacy), the h.264 codec in ffmpeg has a maximum frame size of 4096×2304 (AVC level 5.1).  If your camera generates higher resolution images, you will need to scale the frames or use the Region of Interest (RoI) options to reduce the frame size.
    * NEW: indi-allsky now has the ability to scale the native resolution images during the ffmpeg encoding phase, so you do not need to pre-scale your images.
    * The RaspberryPi HQ camera has a bin1 image size of 4056x3040.  Setting IMAGE_SCALE to 75 in the config results in a image size of 3042x2280.  Alternatively, you can center crop the image using IMAGE_CROP_ROI set to [0, 368, 4056, 2672] for an image size of 4056×2304.
* ffmpeg in Raspbian 11 enables AVC level 6.0+ which permits h.264 resolutions up to 8192×4320 (you must have sufficient system memory)
